This directory is going to hold all of the little scripts and files that don't really belong in any of the other directories. Mainly, they are little bits of testing scripts that I used to get an idea of how well things are going. That's different than the testing directory which is mainly used for testing and development of all types of scripts. 

Basically, the stuff in here is calculations done to support the other stuff in the other directories, not developmental stuff like in the testing directory.
